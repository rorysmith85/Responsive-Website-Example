    <h4>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</h4>
    <h4>by Milan Kundera</h4>
    <p>The Unbearable Lightness of Being explores the idea of "lightness" and heaviness – emptiness and meaning – through the story of two couples; Tomas the surgeon and womaniser who loves his wife, Tereza, and Sabina, a painter conducting an affair with
      a Swiss lecturer, Franz. It's a tapestry of ideas woven through the lives of the characters by the teasing voice of the author-narrator.

    <h3>Literary Criticism</h3>
    <p>Milan Kundera’s novel is certainly one of the very good ones. It is in fact so amazingly better than anything he has written before that the reader can hardly believe it, is continually being lost in astonishment.</p>
    <p>In manner and technique it is not much different from his previous books, but the story here at last really compels us, and so do the hero and heroine. Kundera’s great strength has always been his wit and intelligence, and his particular way with
      these assets.</p>
    <p>He was a Nietzschean truth-teller rather than a Tolstoyan one. But this new novel dissolves my distinction while at the same time drawing attention to it. Its impact is considerable. Whether it will last, whether one will want to read it again, are
      more difficult questions to answer.</p>

    <h3>Milan Kundera</h3>
    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>Milan Kundera, born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, is widely regarded as the most influential contemporary Czech writer. Despite this, he has not had Czech citizenship since it was stripped from him in 1979, and has been a French citizen since 1981.</p>
    <p>As a young student at Charles University, Prague, he became influenced by Marxism. His interest and involvement in Marxism has continued to affect his career ever since. He joined the Communist Party in 1948, was expelled in 1950 and re-joined from
      1965 until 1970, when he was expelled again. His exile came after the publication of his critically acclaimed novel, The Joke (1967), and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Kundera, alongside other communist reform writers, became involved
      in the ‘Prague Spring’of 1968, which aimed for political liberalisation, and which would later influence on of his greatest works, The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1984).</p>
    <p>After the invasion, he was removed from his post of film-studies lecturing, and banned from publishing any more works in Czechoslovakia. Both Life is Elsewhere (1969) which won the Prix Medicis award in France, and The Farewell Party (1972) (or The
      Farewell Waltz) were published abroad, before he relocated to France in 1975.</p>

    <p id="p4">Despite his obvious interest in affairs of the state, Kundera has claimed that novels should not be influenced by politics: they should remain autonomous. It is true to say though, that his experiences in Czechoslovakia and his dalliance with communism
      have inspired his novels, and are essential to some of his stories.</p>
    <p>As well as being tinged with politics, his novels take on a philosophical, dreamy nature in which his early work as a poet is often evident. This is particularly the case in his best known, and most highly praised novels, The Book of Laughter and
      Forgetting (1978) and The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1984).</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>If you want to be an optimist in this life, you have to be a cynic.</p>
      <p>-Milan Kundera</p>
    </div>
    <p>The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (1978) tells seven separate stories, connected to each other by common themes. It is ‘about laughter and about forgetting, about forgetting and about Prague, about Prague and about the angels,’, as Kundera states,
      and highlights perfectly his ability to write the powerful stories despite avoiding traditional linear narratives. The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1984) too, uses his unique and instantly recognisable style of interlinking and connecting both
      stories and people. Both these novels when published were heralded as contemporary classics, and made Kundera an internationally respected author.</p>

    <p id="final-image-text">He has won many awards for his work, notably the Jerusalem Prize, awarded to the author whose work ‘best expresses and promotes the idea of the freedom of the individual in society.’ This not only highlights the importance of Kundera’s work, but also
      summarises his style, politics and indeed many of his characters.</p>
    <p>He has also received the Herder Prize and Czechoslovakia’s top literary prize, the Czech State Literature Prize. Kundera’s ability to interweave philosophy, history, dreams and romance into his stories, whilst also keeping them incredibly readable
      is a testament to his originality and extraordinary talent.</p>
